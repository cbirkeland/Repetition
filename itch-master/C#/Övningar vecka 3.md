Ju fler pandor desto svårare uppgift

## En panda

🐼 Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name. 

🐼 Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names. 

🐼 Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n 

## Två pandor

🐼🐼 Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17. 

    SumNumbers(6) = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
    SumNumbers(11) = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 = 33

Hint:

    To see if a value is a multiple of 3 write:

    bool isAmultipleOfThree = number % 3 == 0;

🐼🐼 Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n. 

🐼🐼 Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12. 

## Fyra pandor


🐼🐼🐼🐼 Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome - no googling :)

🐼🐼🐼🐼 Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,1,b,2,c,3]. 

🐼🐼🐼🐼 Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. 

🐼🐼🐼🐼 Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. The n+1-st Fibonacci number can be computed by adding the n-th and the n-1-th Fibonacci number. The first few are therefore 1, 1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8. 

🐼🐼🐼🐼 Write a function that takes a list of strings an prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame. For example the list ["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"] gets printed as: 

    *********
    * Hello *
    * World *
    * in    *
    * a     *
    * frame *
    *********

## Sex pandor

🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼 Write function that translates a text to Pig Latin and back. English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’. “The quick brown fox” becomes “Hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay”.

1) Write a program to count how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 3 with no remainder. 
Display the result on the console.

2) Write a program and continuously ask the user to enter a number. The loop terminates when the user enters “ok". Calculate the sum of all the previously entered numbers and display it on the console.
  
3) Write a program which takes a single argument from the console, computes the factorial and prints the value on the console. For example, if the user enters 5, the program should calculate 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 
      and display it as 5! = 120.

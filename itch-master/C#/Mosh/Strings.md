1) Write a program and ask the user to enter a few numbers separated by a hyphen. Work out if the numbers are consecutive. For example, if the input is "5-6-7-8-9" or "20-19-18-17-16", display a message: "Consecutive"; otherwise, display "Not Consecutive".

2) Write a program and ask the user to enter a few numbers separated by a hyphen. If the user simply presses Enter without supplying an input, exit immediately; otherwise, check to see if there are any duplicates. If so, display "Duplicate" on the console.

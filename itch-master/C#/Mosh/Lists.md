1) Write a program and continuously ask the user to enter different names, until the user presses Enter 
(without supplying a name). Depending on the number of names provided, display a message based on the above pattern.

2) Ask the user to enter their name. Use an array to reverse the name and then store the result in a new string. 
Display the reversed name on the console.

3) Write a program and ask the user to enter 5 numbers. If a number has been previously entered, display 
an error message and ask the user to re-try. Once the user successfully enters 5 unique numbers, sort them 
and display the result on the console.

4) Write a program and ask the user to continuously enter a number or type "Quit" to exit. The list of numbers may 
include duplicates. Display the unique numbers that the user has entered.

5) Write a program and ask the user to supply a list of comma separated numbers (e.g 5, 1, 9, 2, 10). If the list is 
empty or includes less than 5 numbers, display "Invalid List" and ask the user to re-try; otherwise, display 
the 3 smallest numbers in the list.

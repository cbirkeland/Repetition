the program asks for the speed of a car. If the user enters a value less than the speed limit, program should 
display **Ok** on the console. If the value is above the speed limit, the program should calculate the number of 
**demerit points**. For every 5km/hr above the speed limit, 1 demerit points should be incurred and displayed on 
the console. If the number of demerit points is above 12, the program should display **License Suspended.**
